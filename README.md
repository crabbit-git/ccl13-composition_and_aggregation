# What's this then?

It's a lab exercise assigned as part of a software development course designed, as far as I can tell, to get us more comfy with the concepts of composition, aggregation, and (as a secondary objective) inheritance in Python.

# Right but what does it actually do?

Not a whole lot, since there's no interface or anything. It's just a bunch of class definitions, which incorporate the aforementioned concepts, and a set of pre-written unit tests to ensure that the classes have been defined to spec. The specifications were defined by two things, in effect: a class diagram and a series of unit tests, both of which were provided with the assignment.

You can't really do much with this code other than look at it and run the unit tests on it, but if you want to do the latter, just run `run_tests.py` from a terminal.
